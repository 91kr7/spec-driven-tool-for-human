# /sdd-init — Architecture initialization

Delegates the creation of the architecture described in `$ARGUMENTS` to the `sdd-architect` subagent.

## Role

- You (the main session) are the **orchestrator**: you are not the one creating the architecture.
- It is created by the `sdd-architect` subagent.
- You act as the **broker** between the subagent and the human for questions.

## Steps

1. Get the current date in ISO-8601 format with `date +%Y-%m-%d`.
2. Launch the `sdd-architect` subagent via Task, passing it the stack description (`$ARGUMENTS`) and
   the current date.
3. If the subagent returns questions for the human → apply the convention
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/conventions/question-brokering.md` (orchestrator role): put the questions
   to the user, resume the same subagent with `SendMessage` and repeat until no questions are left.
4. When the subagent has finished, **commit** what it produced, following the convention
   `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/conventions/commit.md`.
5. Report to the user, schematically:
   - the path of the `.archi` produced
   - the skeleton created (main folders and files)

## Delegating to Gemini (on request)

If the user asks to **delegate the initialization to Gemini / Google Antigravity** → do not launch
`sdd-architect`: delegate to the bridge subagent `sdd-gemini-runner` (role `sdd-architect`) following
the convention `${CLAUDE_PLUGIN_ROOT}/conventions/gemini-antigravity-delegation.md`.
